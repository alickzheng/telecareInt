Use what ever framework/tool you want to create this. Ideally you can create it in https://codesandbox.io/ so that we can easily look over it.

A Kanban board is a tool that lets you put tasks/todos into different stages of completion. Generally teams move tasks from backlog/open -> In Progress -> Code Review -> Completed.
